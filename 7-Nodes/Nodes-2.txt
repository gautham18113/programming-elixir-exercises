When I introduced the interval server, I said it sent a tick “about every 2
seconds.” But in the receive loop, it has an explicit timeout of 2,000 ms.
Why did I say “about” when it looks as if the time should be pretty accurate?

The receive process would restart every time a client registers, so the timeout would also
reset in that case.
